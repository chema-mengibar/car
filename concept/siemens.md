# Concept


Digitalization starts in product design where the physical prototypes  
once considered an essential part of the ideation process have now  
been abandoned in favor of detailed, digital designs that are brought  
to life by the CAD software.

## 1. Product design

Automotive product development is all about effciency, productivity and time-to-market.  
How can development engineers create a high-quality product in the shortest possible time and how can the cost intensive and time-consuming tests with physical prototypes be reduced as much as possible?

### Product planning
Product planning is the earliest phase of the product lifecycle. The concepts and ideas are turned into product requirements and program plans. Siemens' common collaboration platform provides core capabilities to manage this transition as well as providing a foundation for information management across the entire lifecycle of products and plants.

### Concept Layout and Styling
With the Siemens software tools, designers get access to a variety of modeling techniques and automotive-specific templates which allow them to explore different options rapidly, without feeling limited by the design tool. Design teams can rapidly capture and create re-usable design and manufacturing elements while they participate in everyday development processes.

### 3D design
All aspects of the automotive design are captured in a single 3D CAD master model. The software facilitates the authoring of composite design data to create a complete 3D product definition, and enables to perform a simulation that assesses producibility issues long before a prototype is manufactured. With all information and detail together in one 3D model, design changes are possible quickly and early in the automotive design process, and then information can efficiently be shared with all teams working concurrently on the design of the vehicle.

### Analysis and Simulation
Continuous embedded simulation and validation provides verification of the methods and resources being selected. Through the use of simulation, engineering studies and "what-if" analyses the need for physical tryouts is reduced. Vehicle performance testing for a range of applications in an integrated environment is also possible. The process model can easily be shown to others using visual displays of exact operations, resource layout, and their use, resulting in a proven, right-first-time manufacturing plan.

### Development test rigs
Intensive research and development and fulfilling the most demanding production quality requirements is crucial for automotive manufacturers and their suppliers.

This calls for testing equipment that can offer realistic, practical simulations for the entire range of mechanical loads faced by vehicles and units, while allowing rapid recording and analysis of measured values. Siemens offers engine test rigs, gear test rigs, vehicle test Rigs (Research & Development), and CATS flexible test rig automation system.
