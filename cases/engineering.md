The Engineering development starts with the definition of the vehicle packaging (wheelbase, track, main external and internal dimensions) that represents the first technical input for the overall vehicle development. The starting point is the platform complete of powertrain, chassis and mechanical components and systems normally supplied by the customer.

Engineering works simultaneously with Styling thanks also to the extensive use of the Virtual Reality Center, using CAD,CAS, CAE and DMU technologies. As soon as the sketches and renderings are completed, a team of engineers carry out simultaneous verifications on CAS surfaces to verify the technical feasibility and coherence with the vehicle targets.

Aerodynamic simulations and tunnel tests allow the styling surfaces to be optimized ensuring that aerodynamic targets are achieved. The manufacturing constraints and requirements are taken into account to guarantee the technological feasibility in the production plants.

The integration between Engineering and Styling, with the simultaneous exchange and full sharing of information and data (common database), allows the optimization of the development times and costs.

Full integration with the customer Process Technology and Manufacturing to ensure that the technical solutions are feasible and can be manufactured and put into production, examining their compatibility with the production methods and tooling/equipment used in the production plants. The different component suppliers are fully integrated and managed according to the vehicle scheduling plan agreed with the customer. The Virtual Car is in real time continuously assembled and updated to check with DMU tools that the geometrical constraints and targets (clearances, gaps, assemblyâ€¦) are fulfilled.


## 1. Design

With the help of computer-aided design equipment, designers develop basic concept drawings that help them visualize the proposed vehicle's appearance. Based on this simulation, they then construct clay models that can be studied by styling experts familiar with what the public is likely to accept.  
Aerodynamic engineers also review the models, studying air-flow parameters and doing feasibility studies on crash tests.  
Only after all models have been reviewed and accepted are tool designers permitted to begin building the tools that will manufacture the component parts of the new model.

## 2. The Manufacturing Process

### Components
The automobile assembly plant represents only the final phase in the process of manufacturing an automobile, for it is here that the components supplied by more than 4,000 outside suppliers, including company-owned parts suppliers, are brought together for assembly, usually by truck or railroad. Those parts that will be used in the chassis are delivered to one area, while those that will comprise the body are unloaded at another

### Chassis
The frame forms the base on which the body rests and from which all subsequent assembly components follow

### Heavy components
vehicle's engine with its transmission. Workers use robotic arms to install these heavy components inside the engine compartment of the frame  
Careful ergonomic studies of every assembly task have provided assembly workers with the safest and most efficient tools available.

### Body
-  floor pan is the largest body
- The front and rear door pillars, roof, and body side panels are assembled
- s the body moves from the isolated weld area of the assembly line, subsequent body components including fully assembled doors, deck lids, hood panel, fenders  

### Paint
- Prior to painting, the body must pass through a rigorous inspection process
-

### Interior assembly
- workers assemble all of the instrumentation and wiring systems, dash panels, interior lights, seats, door and trim panels

### Mate
Once the mating takes place the automobile proceeds down the line to receive final trim components, battery, tires, anti-freeze, and gasoline  

##  Quality Control
All of the components that go into the automobile are produced at other sites. This means the thousands of component pieces that comprise the car must be manufactured, tested, packaged, and shipped to the assembly plants, often on the same day they will be used. This requires no small amount of planning. To accomplish it, most automobile manufacturers require outside parts vendors to subject their component parts to rigorous testing and inspection audits similar to those used by the assembly plants.
