Methodology of vehicle production applied to the creation of web applications

## Abstract
In manufacturing automobiles, the assembly line consists of stages that are automated–from building the exterior parts like chassis, body, and engine–then to the assembling of interior parts and painting, and finally to the inspection or quality testing. Once it passes the QA inspection, the car is delivered to the car dealership.  

In the software development process, a DevOps pipeline is comparable to an assembly line. A DevOps pipeline is focused on automating and connecting the different tasks performed by several teams, such as continuous integration for developers, test automation for testers, code deployment by release managers and so on.

This project is not intended to create a Devops pipeline but to include the process of design, development and assembly of the components of the final application.
